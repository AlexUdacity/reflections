What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new hidden file is created called .git, and this file stores the metadata from all previous commits. Without initializing a repository, this file won't be created, and thus no data can be stored.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is like a popup warning you "Do you want to make this change?" so that you think about it before continuing as there is no going back.
